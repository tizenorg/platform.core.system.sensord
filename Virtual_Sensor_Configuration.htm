<h3>NAME</h3>
<p>Name of the Virtual Sensor</p>

<h3>VENDOR</h3>
<p>Name of the vendor who developed Orientation virtual sensor.</p>

<h3>RAW_DATA_UNIT</h3>
<p>Units for the raw data output from the Orientation virtual sensor.</p>

<h3>DEFAULT_SAMPLING_TIME</h3>
<p>Default sampling interval (in msec) value at which the Orientation
virtual sensor is initialized.</p>

<h3>ACCEL_STATIC_BIAS</h3>
<p>The static bias value for accelerometer X, Y and Z axis data is
computed when the device is at rest with an device orientation (pitch,
roll, yaw) as (0, 0, 0). The non-zero accelerometer data values observed
on the X, Y and Z axis are the bias values to be entered respectively.
The entered bias values would be subtracted from the accelerometer input
data in the pre-processing stage of the sensor fusion algorithm.</p>

<h3>GYRO_STATIC_BIAS</h3>
<p>The static bias value for gyroscope X, Y and Z axis data is computed
when the device is at rest with an device orientation (pitch, roll, yaw)
as (0, 0, 0). The non-zero gyroscope data values observed on the X, Y and
Z axis are the bias values to be entered respectively. The entered bias
values would be subtracted from the gyroscope input data in the
pre-processing stage of the sensor fusion algorithm.</p>

<h3>GEOMAGNETIC_STATIC_BIAS</h3>
<p>The static bias value for geomagnetic sensor X, Y and Z axis data is
computed when the device is at rest with an device orientation (pitch, roll,
yaw) as (0, 0, 0). The non-zero geomagnetic sensor data values observed on
the X, Y and Z axis are the bias values to be entered respectively. The
entered bias values would be subtracted from the geomagnetic sensor input
data in the pre-processing stage of the sensor fusion algorithm.</p>

<h3>ACCEL_ROTATION_DIRECTION_COMPENSATION</h3>
<p>The rotation direction compensation for each axis X, Y and Z is assigned a
value of "1" if the clockwise rotation of the device for the particular axis
results in positive change in accelerometer data values. The rotation
direction compensation for each axis is assigned a value of "-1" if for the
clockwise rotation of the device for the particular axis results in negative
increase in accelerometer data value.</p>
